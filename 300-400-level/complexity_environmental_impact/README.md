Assignments in this folder introduce students to the environmental impact of computing and study how it relates to complexity.

The assignment uses the Python3 package energyusage.  A pending update should change the used package to be [CodeCarbon](https://codecarbon.io).

The slides introduce the methodology behind that measurement and more information can be found in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08354
